## Overview

This week was a quick introduction to the javascript library three.js

## Projects

- 3D Wedding Invitation

## Assignment Details

Create a project using 3D models, shapes and text using three.js

## Weekly Report

### Shapes
After adding the basic cube shape, I did some digging into other shapes available in three.js geometry. I settled on the torus. Then I manipulated the parameters until I got a thin ring shape. I added a second ring and had it spin at a different value, so it looked like two intertwinning golden rings.

At this point I knew I absolutely had to make a 3D wedding invitation, with spinning rings and a forest scene below.

### Models

I've only created a 3D model in photoshop, but since Photoshop doesn't allow you to export in the format we need for three.js, so I looked online and I downloaded a free low-poly pine tree from Sketchfab/theCrafter. Then the struggles began. It took hours to just display this model. That's because I was using the wrong loader file from three.js library. I also had the wrong type of 3D model. So, after converting the model from a gflt to a glb, I had it displayed, but it was huge compared to my rings.

![finally, the model displays](screenshot_display1.png)

The screenshot above shows the 3D model tree was not green and the wrong size. It was also appearing in the same position as the rings and not below. I needed to fix a few things.

- color FIXED
- size/ scale FIXED
- position FIXED
- camera angle tweaked

I fixed the color by adding in some lighting. I choose directional lighting and had it shine from above.

The scale was harder to fix, because I didn't understand the name of my object and how to scale it down. However, after a few more hours of research, I found a website forum post describing how to fix a dark model. (https://discourse.threejs.org/t/solved-glb-model-is-very-dark/6258) When loading their model they used `scale.set(1,1,1)` and `position.set(0,0,0)` for the position of the model. The hardest part for me was figuring out I had to have `gltf.scene` in addition to the `.scale.set(1,1,1)`. Here was my final solution:

```JS
function load_model(){
  loader.load('models/pine.glb', function(gltf) {

    scene.add(gltf.scene);
    gltf.scene.scale.set(.15,.15,.15); // THIS finally fixes the scale of model
      gltf.scene.position.set(0, -40, 0); // This moves the position of the model lower

}, undefined, function(error) {
    console.error(error);
});
}
```

## TEXT for Invitation
I wanted a script font, so I converted one of google's free fonts named Kaushan Regular into a json file. I used this free website to do the conversion. (https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/)

I had some trouble loading the font, but used the example from Week 14 lessons. Once again I has strange position, right in the middle of the scene. It overlapped with my tree and was not readable. Not that text would ever be readable in 3D. I still needed to adjust the posistion, somehow.

I tried to follow my solution for the model, and added this `text.position.set(0,20,10);` This shifted the 3D text to the side of my model. Initially I was hoping to move it above, but the side worked.

To add the rest of my invitation text, I used three.js's suggestion and added some HTML and CSS. The code below created a text box above the 3D scene.

```CSS
div{ position: absolute;
  left: 200px;
  top 0px;
  background-color: #f3d2f9;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
  ```

## Problems or Issues this week

I struggled with the tutorials this week. I read the tips and tricks page, but it was like reading a foreign language. Also, Three.js website has examples, but their examples do not show the code used. I had to dig through the developer tools to try and understand what the examples were doing, and it rarely helped. I had a very specific problem and didn't know how to fix it.

Luckily, after I took a break, I was able to come back with fresh eyes and find my solution.

## Conclusion

Once I started playing with the shapes and created two revolving rings, I knew immediately what I wanted to create. A 3D wedding invitation, but having this vision limited me. I couldn't just experiment and see what might happen. I had no flexibility with this project. I needed to make sure the tree was exactly where I wanted and at the right size, so I struggled trying to make this happen. Sometimes, I think I enjoy art when I experiment and do have any expectations for the result.
