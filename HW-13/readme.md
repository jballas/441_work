## Assignment Details

Create a project using 3D models, shapes and text using three.js

## Weekly Report

### Shapes
After adding the basic cube shape, I did some digging into other shapes available in three.js geometry. I settled on the torus. Then I manipulated the parameters until I got a thin ring shape. I added a second ring and had it spin at a difference value, so it looked like two intertwinning golden rings.

### Models

My only experiments with 3D models was creating one in photoshop, but since Photoshop doesn't allow you to export in the correct file format that we need for three.js, I had to look for some available online. I discovered a website called Creazilla (https://creazilla.com). This website had various Creative Commons vector and 3Dmodels, some of them highly detailed and others low poly. I downloaded some trees and then tried to figure out how to import them into my scene.
