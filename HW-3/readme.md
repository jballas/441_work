My first step in making my Adventure Game was pre-production. I knew the code was going to challenge me, so I wanted the story and art ready to impliment. This way I could focus on the code.

### Coding
My first success was a simple JS script.
```JS
<script>
  document.write("It begins");
  document.write("<h2>Title?</h2>");
</script>
```

It works! I added text to DOM with document.write.
Now, how do I make the choices? I'll need to use an if statement, or if/else statement, or if/if/else statements.
