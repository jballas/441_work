## Weekly Report
### Steps

What to add
      1. Add a text input box to input the charcter's name
2. add a for loop, or while loop
      3. Add an if/else if/ else or switch statements
      4. add a parameter within a function
      5. return a value from a function
      7. add a restart button to restart the story
      - & Change where the story appears. So the buttons disappear!! One div Story box!!
    6. update the style/images with javascript function
8. Make sure there are 5 choices to the story

### Process
I'm not even sure where to start with this one. With inputting character name?

Do I need to add IDs to all my buttons.. (is that important?)


### Fixing Pick Title Function / simplying with functions and parameters
I'm interested in fixing the 2 functions problem I had. last time I had `pick_title()` and `pick_title2()` So, click on one button and 1 function ran, or click on another button and a seperate function ran. it worked, but made the code cluttered.
I needed a title function to

click button glitch to start glitch story.
or click button multiverse to start

I use a switch statement and parameters to make this work. Now. there is 1 variable called 'title' and I use it throughout. I think I can replicated this so there is 1 variable for desire, and one for action too.

I hate using numbers for my parameter values. I'm trying to figure out if I can use strings?

Next I want to make the stories appear in only 1 central div, instead of being divided into 2 seperate columns....

### Layout update
Previously, I had two columns, so one story appeared on the left and one on the right. Now, I've combined the stories and I want to have them only show up in one main story box. Time to fix some HTML, then update my script.js.


### Style changes
  I created a new_universe function so that whenever the player enters a new universe in the story the style is updated. The style change is also random between two numbers. I used Math.random, and made sure it rounded the number, so it was 0 or 1.

  Next up, adding a loop somewhere. How though...
