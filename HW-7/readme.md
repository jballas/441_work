### Class and Object study

I'm switching up my process this week, I want to focus first on coding the basics, then try to expand upon the design upon that with some css.


Beginning with simply displaying one image, it is amazing to me how end one simple task goes completely wrong when you don't connect the dots. I thought I had everything (I did) but I wasn't linking my script file correctly, so nothing was displaying. Anyway, it is fixed and I have a new object that displays an image. This could also be accomplished by simply displaying the image in HTML, but that's not the point. We're trying to make random images appear, and the only way to do that is with js. So, like last week, I'm going to add my image into the HTML and then change the src with js. I don't know why I find this awkward compared to just adding the entire image.

Back at it.
