## Research and Game Design

The idea behind my game is a love of picking huckleberries in the summer with my family. We spend the afternoon driving up into the mountains, our favorite location is of course a secret. The forest road winds upward, and we hike a little and spend a few hours picking huckleberries. Would that make a game? I wondered. I wanted this to be a cross between Celeste and Animal Crossing, but with a bittersweet story about a young girl living in the woods and trying to survive by picking huckleberries. She's cursed, and has been transformed into a bear. The goal of the game is to survive and discover a way up the mountain, but also to solve the mystery of her curse.

## Artwork

Some of the artwork I created myself, some of it I sourced from free vector sites, and the tilemap was designed by Art by Elthan from itch.io's free game assets store. The mood needs to capture the adventurous spirit of the game, since you'll be climbing a mountain, on an RPG like map. There's cliffs and a river to cross and a mountaintop to reach. Tiled is a program that allows you to make maps based on pixel art. It is a visual program but it exports as a json file. You can also attach properties to the map, such as whether there are collisions. (1)

## Coding

### TileMap and Collisions
 After creating my map, I wanted to see how collisions would work. So, I started off with a simple phaser program, much like what we created in week 12.
