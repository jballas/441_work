## Assignment Details

Setup a basic game scenario with two objects that can interact.


## Weekly Report

Our lessons this week were very hands-on, meaning we had a lot of coding challenges and debugging. I began with the simple task of making some HTML 5 rectangles move across the screen, animated and then with controls. Immediately, I wanted to have both objects and I jumped straight into making a class called `class Bug`.

I didn't have any idea what kind of game this would create, or other game mechanics or the game's theme, I just wanted to focus on coding.

## Boundary
One bug was blue colored, so I had a variable named blue_bug that ran diagonal across the screen. I struggled creating a boundary for my animated blue_bug. I remembered from p5.js that you had to multiple something by -1, but the math just illuded me, so I ended up looking up a hint from the p5.js website. Using their example of a bouncing ball, I created a moving object that bounced against the canvas boundary. (https://p5js.org/examples/motion-bounce.html)

## Objects
My second bug was the player controlled bug. After creating my class I struggled with getting the each object to do a different thing. It was easy to make the object both bounce across the screen, but having one player controlled and one animated, was tricky to figure out.

I also struggled to make the objects collide. Hours of debugging later, I found out I'd typed in the collision example wrong. I had < instead of > or object2.width instead of object1.width.
