# Week 2 Response
## Date
## MART441.50, Julia Ballas


## Overview

This week included an introduction to Javascript's console log, as well as exploration into interactive websites.

## Projects

- javascript rules!
- script.js


## Assignment Details
Create a simple javascript program with the `console.log` function
```js
console.log("Information put into the console log.");
```

## Theme of the Week: Interactive Websites
As we begin to learn about javascript and its uses in web design, I started specifically look at the interactive parts of website. It is everywhere, but easily overlooked because it is so seemless in the design. Of course, bad design stands out too.

Some of my favorite interactive artists include Martin Silvestre, specifically for his Drink Cann (http://www.drinkcann.com/). The website uses parallax scrolling and the animations with a  bubbly fun feeling. The design perfectly captures the product it features, which makes it so appealing.

## Problems or Issues this week
Nothing to report. This was a fairly easy week so we could continue to study html and css in more detail, and getting comfortable with the web console and console.log function. I will be curious to see how we use the console.log in practice.

## Conclusion
As we delve deeper into javascript, I am starting to brainstorm ideas about what kind of interactions I want to try. I'm curious about implimenting rotation into web design. And if you can incorporate isometric design into a website. I want to create falling text, or text that collapses, as if a website is broken. I have seen an example of this in a video game and I want to try to recreate the idea. I am curious about recreating typewriter text.
