## Theme of the Week: Interactive Websites
As we begin to learn about javascript and its uses in web design, I started specifically look at the interactive parts of website. It is everywhere, but easily overlooked because it is so seemless in the design. Of course, bad design stands out too.

Some of my favorite interactive artists include Martin Silvestre, specifically for his Drink Cann (http://www.drinkcann.com/). The website uses parallax scrolling and the animations with a  bubbly fun feeling. The design perfectly captures the product it features, which makes it so appealing.

Jon Way's website( http://jonway.studio) for the overall design aestheitc. The images and type feel oldschool, yet the design is very modern. And lastly, Sacha Touroulou (http://sachatourtoulou.com), who is a young designer in France. His portfolio site is very inspiring, from the loading screen to the menu and

## Problems or Issues this week
Nothing to report. This was a fairly easy week so we could continue to study html and css in more detail, and getting comfortable with the web console and console.log function. I will be curious to see how we use the console.log in practice.

## Conclusion
As we delve deeper into javascript, I am starting to brainstorm ideas about what kind of interactions I want to try. I'm curious about implimenting rotation into web design. And maybe trying my hand at isometric design or adding game elements. I want to experiment with creating falling text, or text that collapses, as if a website is broken. I have seen examples of this playful style and I'm curious to try and recreate it.
