## Weekly Report

This week was an exploration and reintruduction to github. I have used the website in several classes, Creative Coding 1, and Intro to Web. For coding it is so important to be be able to track changes and experiment in different ways, and github makes that process easy, as long as you save and commit those changes. I struggled a bit with organization of my file, and learned you can't rename folders. Instead, I had to create a new one and move the files into the new one. I also recall that sometimes I will save but forget to commit and then make significant changes and I can't go back, because I never commited, which is frustrating.

I started with a test website, so I could experiment with coding and refamiliarize myself with working in CSS and HTML, but I quickly became frustrated with my workflow. I layed out some html first, with various `div` tags so I could experiment with float and padding.

## Problems or Issues this week
Like any new language, which you stop using it, or learning new words you will quickly forget details. I can read html and css, but I can't remember it at all. I ended up looking up a lot of simple things, like how to make comments in HTML and how to make comments in CSS. I needed refershers on CSS more than HTML, basically everything specific. 

Buttons are convenient to add, but after struggling with the look, I had to reference W3 schools to see how to style, and size them evenly. It feels like I don't know how to do anything without looking up details.
