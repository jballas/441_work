## Overview
This week begins our exploration into the javascript library known as jQuery. Using jQuery will simply our code and allow us to experiment with animation.

## Projects

- jQuery art project: silent movie
-

## Assignment Details

Create a jQuery based art project, with shapes, words, images that are animated and fade in and out.

## Process

- HTML and CSS
  - create main page with border and play movie button
- Coding
  - add jquery to make the star flicker


  Getting my CSS and html layout always takes longer than I expect, but once I had it, I got my first start to fade in and out. It doens't do this continuously though. I want the efffect to keep happening until the button is pushed.

I can make a loop that will continue to made the star `fadeIn()` and `fadeOut()` for 5 times, and then it will `fadeToggle()` when you push the button. But that's not what I want. I want it to keep flickering, until you push the button.


  So, I'm going to try a while statement.

The logic: The star is flickering while we wait, and then fades out when the button is pushed.

I think that works.

Mostly, I think I need to work on my logic.
