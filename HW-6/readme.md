###
 Although I know HTML and CSS, I don't have it memorized, so every week I should test myself by trying to create an HTML document from scratch. Instead, I copy and pasted Week 5 and grab for my notes on how to create forms and input fields and I reminded myself how HTML forms work, with `<fieldset>` and `<labels>`.

Sounds like we're going to connect 3 pages. The Player enters their details, they play the game and then in goes to a third page to display them.


## Problems or Issues this week

In Week 5 I created my memory game to display images inside of various `<div>`. Then I could access each `<div>` by its Id. Unfortunately, that is causing problems in trying to flip the cards back to blank. If I put my blank image back inside the `<div>` then the random image previously used doesn't appear. I'm sure there is a way past this, maybe involving a boolean logic, so if the image is clicked it is considered true and displays the random image, but then if it doesn't match, it is blank again. Maybe I'd run into the same problem as before, maybe not. However, we're approaching this memory game using different logic, using image sources in arrays and flipping images around using the `setTimeout` in JS. So, I have to rearrange all my code again, to make images display from the .src, rather than .innerHTML.

I'm a bit frustrated this week because I can't try anything else. If there are other solutions to making the memory game, I don't know how. So, I'm forced to base my game and homework, exactly around the sample. I can't deviate and it doesn't feel like I'm working the code on my own, just following directions. I suppose it comes down to inexperience.
